CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------

Base Name:
  The new name for your files (e.g., "Video" becomes "Video_1.mp4")

Separator:
  Character between name and number (default: _ underscore)
  Examples: "_" → Video_1  |  "-" → Video-1  |  " " → Video 1

Start Number:
  First number in sequence (usually 1)

Zero Padding:
  - Auto-detect: Automatically adds zeros based on file count
    (1-9 files → no padding, 10-99 → 01, 100+ → 001)
  - No Padding: 1, 2, 3, 10, 100
  - 2 Digits: 01, 02, 03
  - 3 Digits: 001, 002, 003

Sort By:
  - Alphabetical: Sort by filename A-Z
  - Date Modified: Sort by when file was last changed
  - Date Created: Sort by when file was created
  - Selection Order: Keep the order you selected files

If Conflict (when a file with new name already exists):
  - Skip: Don't rename files that would conflict
  - Add Suffix: Add "_copy" to the filename
  - Auto-increment: Find next available number

PREVIEW SECTION
---------------
Colors indicate status:
  GREEN  (✓) - Ready to rename
  YELLOW (⚠) - Warning/conflict detected
  RED    (✗) - Error (locked file, invalid name, etc.)

Always check the preview before clicking "Rename Files"!

TIPS
----
• Close files in other programs before renaming (prevents lock errors)
• Use "Auto-detect" padding for most cases
• Sort by "Date Created" for camera files to maintain order
• Test with 2-3 files first if unsure
